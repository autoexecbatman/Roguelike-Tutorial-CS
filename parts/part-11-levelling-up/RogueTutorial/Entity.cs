/*
 * Anything that occupies one cell and is drawn on top of the map: the player, a monster,
 * later an item lying on the floor.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     Entity player = new Entity("Player", '@', Color.White, new Point(40, 12), blocksMovement: true);
 *     Entity corpse = new Entity("Corpse", '%', Color.Red, new Point(41, 12), blocksMovement: false);
 *
 *     rat.Fighter = new Fighter(maximumHitPoints: 4, attack: 3, defence: 0);
 *     bool canFight = rat.Fighter is not null;   // -> true until it dies
 *     player.MoveTo(new Point(41, 12));   // unconditional; see MovementRules for the rules
 *     string who = player.Name;           // -> "Player", for messages in a later part
 *
 * Fighter is the component that lets an entity take part in combat. It is null for anything that
 * cannot fight - an item on the floor, or a corpse, which is a monster whose Fighter was removed
 * when it died. A component rather than a subclass, because an object cannot change its own type
 * in C# and death has to change what an entity is capable of.
 *
 * blocksMovement is explicit at every call: a creature occupies its cell and nothing else may
 * stand there, while an item on the floor is walked over. There is no default, because guessing
 * wrong is silent - you notice when a player walks through a monster.
 *
 * Refuses a null, empty or whitespace name. It applies no movement rules of its own: whether a
 * destination is legal is the map's business, and MovementRules is where the two meet.
