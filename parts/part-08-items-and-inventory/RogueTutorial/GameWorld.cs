/*
 * Everything the game is: the dungeon, who is standing in it, and what the player has seen.
 *
 * This exists because the state had outgrown the screen class. RootScreen cannot be constructed
 * without a graphics host, so anything living on it is beyond the reach of a test - the same
 * boundary Part 1 drew for rules, applied now to state. A GameWorld can be built, driven and
 * inspected in a test process with no window anywhere.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     GameWorld world = GameWorld.Generate(80, 25, new Random(12345), MonsterTable.Standard);
 *
 *     world.MovePlayer(new Point(1, 0));                  // one step right, or an attack
 *     world.PickUpHere();                                  // take what is underfoot
 *     world.UseItem(slot: 0);                              // drink the first thing in the pack
 *     bool over = world.IsPlayerDead;                      // the game ends when this is true
 *     IReadOnlyList<string> said = world.Log.Latest(5);    // what just happened
 *     Point where = world.Player.Position;
 *     RenderedFrame frame = world.ComposeFrame();         // what the player currently perceives
 *     Entity? blocker = world.BlockingEntityAt(where);    // null when the cell is clear
 *
 * Refuses a null argument anywhere. Generation refuses a map too small to hold a room, which is
 * the DungeonGenerator's rule rather than this one.
