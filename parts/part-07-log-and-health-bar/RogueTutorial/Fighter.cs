/*
 * What an entity needs in order to fight: hit points, and the two numbers that decide damage.
 *
 * This is a component rather than a kind of entity. A corpse and a sword both stop being able to
 * fight, and an object cannot change its own type in C# - so "can fight" is something an entity
 * has or does not have, and death removes it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     Fighter rat = new Fighter(maximumHitPoints: 4, attack: 3, defence: 0);
 *
 *     int dealt = rat.TakeDamage(2);      // -> 2, and HitPoints falls to 2
 *     bool dead = rat.IsDead;             // -> false
 *     rat.TakeDamage(99);                 // HitPoints floors at 0 rather than going negative
 *
 * Refuses a maximum below one, and negative attack, defence or damage. Healing arrives in
 * Part 8 with potions; there is nothing here that raises hit points yet.
