/*
 * The whole screen as data: the dungeon on top, the health bar under it, the message log below
 * that.
 *
 * Part 2 made the map assertable by building it as a RenderedFrame before drawing it. This does
 * the same for the interface, and for the same reason: a health bar that reads the wrong numbers
 * or a log showing the wrong lines is a defect nothing else can see.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     ScreenLayout layout = new ScreenLayout(80, 25, logRows: 5);
 *     RenderedFrame screen = ScreenComposer.Compose(world, layout);
 *
 *     string picture = screen.ToText();          // the map, then the panel, as lines
 *     char here = screen.GlyphAt(new Point(0, 20));
 *
 * The map is composed exactly as before and copied into the top of the frame, so nothing about
 * how the dungeon is drawn changes. Refuses a null argument, and a world whose map is taller
 * than the layout's map area.
